# Simple mass rename (Alpha Version)

This application is designed to facilitate the bulk renaming of files based on user-defined parameters. Currently in its alpha stage, the application is primarily focused on providing core functionality, with more advanced features planned for future releases.

## Features

- **Bulk File Renaming**: Rename multiple files at once according to specified rules.

## Why This Application?

While searching for a simple and intuitive file renaming tool, I found existing solutions to be overly complex and not user-friendly. This application is designed to be straightforward and focused on functionality, making it easier to rename large sets of files, such as TV show episodes, without unnecessary complications.
